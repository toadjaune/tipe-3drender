# 3drender

This program is a 3D engine, able to render 3D scenes including light sources, mirrors and textures, using a raytracer system.
It also includes a few texture generators.

The program was thought in the context of a school project, and was not intended to be distributed and used easily out of this context. This repository is more expected to be used as an archive, showing what the program is able to do, than as a real editable project.
